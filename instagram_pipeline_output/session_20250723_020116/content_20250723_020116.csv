LPT Forget the wi-fi network on an airplane it’s free again,"I’m on an AA flight & the wi-fi is free for 20 minutes, after watching an Ad about their loyalty program. Lol, after it expired, I just went into my phone wi-fi settings, forgot the network and rejoined for free, after another ad.  Edit: different airlines may have hourly options and not just subscriptions like these. I used their Wi-fi to post this. Or you can pay $49.95 a month for 1 device. 59.95 for two devices.

LPT: If a friend starts experiencing any form of domestic violence start secretly collecting evidence for them as soon as you suspect something,"The best thing you can do for a friend you suspect is starting to experiencing abuse is start collecting any evidence right away.  Write  journal entries and email to yourself, collect sound bites, pictures,  etc. There's a great chance your friend won't want to hear your advice or opinions on the matter and will reject and need to realize what's happening on their own. As denial is a comom theme for victims of abuse theres a chance they don't have enough or even any evidence of abuse especially if its psychological. Once they are ready, having a paper trail ready for them to use is a huge gift.","LPT: If a friend starts experiencing any form of domestic violence start secretly collecting evidence for them as soon as you suspect something.

Scientists in Japan develop plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours,"Takuzo Aiden, project lead, said “Children cannot choose the planet they will live on. It is our duty as scientists to ensure we leave them with the best possible environment.” Aiden said that the new material is as strong as petroleum-based products but breaks down into its original components when exposed to salt. Those components can then be further processed by naturally occurring bacteria, thereby avoiding generating microplastics that can harm aquatic life and enter the food chain. As salt is also present in soil, a piece about five centimetres (two inches) in size disintegrates on land after over 200 hours, he added.  The material can be used like regular plastic when coated, and the team are focusing their current research on the best coating methods.

I tried stuff I looked up on the internet like drinking water, blink fast, looking up, thinking of “happy”things, stuff like that but apart from looking stupid I didn’t get any results. So if you guys have any tips that would prevent that I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!","LPT request: how to not cry in stressful situations ?.

LPT: Dry brining is a very easy way to up your meat cooking game,"It just takes a little foresight. Pull your meat out of the fridge and generously salt it. Let it come to room temperature and pat it dry before cooking it. Osmosis will draw the water from the meat to the salt, and then re-absorb it. Give it a nice sear until golden brown, and finish it off over indirect heat if you have to. Use a thermometer to know when to pull it out and rest it in foil until final temp. End result is tender, perfectly seasoned meat. Dense cuts like beef can take a dry brine overnight. Fish can be as short as 10 minutes. Foodie blogs have tables for how long to brine each individual cut. Live to eat, don't just eat to live. Your taste buds will thank you.","LPT: Dry brining is a very easy way to up your meat cooking game. It just takes a little foresight. Pull your meat out of the fridge and generously salt it.

"LPT: If you want to fall asleep faster, tell yourself a boring story instead of trying to clear your mind.","Six months ago, I was that person who'd lie in bed for hours with my brain going crazy. I'd try all the classic advice - count sheep, clear your thoughts, focus on breathing. Nothing worked. My mind just kept racing. Then I accidentally discovered something that changed everything. One night I was so frustrated that I started telling myself the most boring story I could think of. Like describing someone doing laundry step by step. I was out in 10 minutes. Here's what I learned: Your brain needs something to focus on, not nothing. When you try to think of nothing, it panics and starts generating random thoughts. But give it a boring task and it calms down. The key is making it really mundane. I usually go with someone making a sandwich. Every tiny detail. Getting the bread from the bag, opening the jar, spreading the peanut butter slowly, wiping the knife, closing the jar. Sometimes I do someone grocery shopping. Walking through the automatic doors, grabbing a cart, going down each aisle, picking up milk, checking the expiration date. The story has to be boring enough that your brain doesn't get excited, but detailed enough that it stays occupied. No drama, no interesting characters, just pure mundane stuff. I've been doing this for months and I rarely stay awake more than 15 minutes now. It's like giving your brain a boring movie to watch until it falls asleep.","LPT: If you want to fall asleep faster, tell yourself a boring story instead of trying to clear your mind..

Boredom will tell you who you are,"If you don’t know what you want out of life, it could be because you’ve been distracted to such an extent that you’ve lost touch with who you are. This can and does happen; chronic distraction makes it so you avoid emotions, especially the bad ones, which leads to more avoidance in the future, and that's one way how you end up with alexithymia. Your feelings start to only communicate with you on the surface; they lose their essence, and this can be confusing; fear can be anger, anger can be disappointment, etc. For example, you may dislike your job, but you probably don’t fully understand what deeply bothers you about it. Or your friends, your interests, etc You may want to scream or cry, and don’t even realise it. Boredom does help with this, well, now we call it boredom since we barely give ourselves time to sit down and think. Unstructured thinking time and idle time are very much needed for your body; that time is used to go through what happens in the day, help you sift through your emotions, etc Let’s do a quick test: Can you put the phone down and do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes? no? Well, my friend, it's time for some much-needed alone time. It doesn’t feel good, you’re going to be emotionally pent up and have a lot of emotional debt to go through, but it gets better, eventually. The pleasure that comes with silence, being present, things slowing down, and you knowing who you are and what you want, is hard to exaggerate. It’s strange and beautiful to see stillness and yourself slowing down, to know what you actually feel, and to be able to put together what you want out of life. Also, and maybe this isn’t advertised enough, boredom can breed creativity; it can actually become a problem if you meditate. People who meditate will know what I’m talking about. Sometimes the ideas you get while meditating are so good you have to stop the session just to write them down.","Boredom will tell you who you are.

But dumping your unfiltered thoughts on someone, even if it is your partner will overwhelm them, derail the conversation, and will not do a good job of conveying what you want.  Pausing for even a couple of seconds before you respond gives your brain time to process what was actually said, not just how it made you feel. Psychologically, this activates your prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for thoughtful decision-making, instead of defaulting to the amygdala, which reacts impulsively and emotionally.  Given how much of our mind is preoccupied with stuff, often our minds transfer emotional burden (anger, pain, sadness) onto any available outlet. Often it is the people closest to us. Whether I’m making up after a fight with my partner, listening to a friend who’s venting, or stuck in a difficult conversation at work, I’ve learned to pause before saying anything and ask myself: Will what I’m about to say, hurtful or not, actually make anyone feel better or move this forward in a healthy way? This small window of time will help you feel better about yourself. You won’t even regret saying something at the spur of the moment and over time, people will feel safer and more comfortable around you.","LPT: Always take a pause before responding when you find yourself being emotional.

LPT: how to get your reluctant self into the door of the gym,"Keep a gym bag in your car with your gym clothes and a towel (unless your gym provides towels) and a toiletry kit. Walk in the gym with it. Do your thing and then shower there. Use your stuff, walk out just like you walked in.  For me, having to get dressed and wander around the house finding stuff to get ready to go killed it completely. It absolutely destroyed momentum. It killed the idea of going. Sometimes it's difficult to make yourself go. Having to wander around and find stuff is an absolute dead end. The gym bag method works. If you feel the need to whine about the gym showers being somehow less than perfect or whatever other whiny complaint, then you're just making excuses. The gym is the fountain of youth. Every time I leave, I feel better physically and mentally. No exception, not a single one. Your brain tries to trick you into not going. I don't know why. It's kind of amazing. So get in the door! Getting in the door is the entire battle.","LPT: how to get your reluctant self into the door of the gym.

29F — I’m DONE living this way.  It changes TODAY.,"I’m finally just completely fed up with myself and my lifestyle. I was laying here crying an hour ago feeling sorry for myself for my weight, my messy room, my loneliness, etc. and I just had an epiphany moment that maybe should’ve been obvious to me but it really just hit me how none of this is the fault of ANYBODY or ANYTHING except myself.  I’m not overweight because of my breakup last year, or the holidays, or starting a new job, or my depression meds, or my IUD. I’m like this because I MADE THE DECISIONS that led to it. I choose laziness. I choose self pity. I choose to live an undisciplined, messy, self sabotaging life. I’ve been CHOOSING IT FOR YEARS. I lost 20lbs last year by simply counting calories and walking every day. I gained it all back and blamed everything except myself.  I simply cannot live this way anymore. This is no “I’ll start Monday” or “I’ll start after summer” or “I’ll start tomorrow”. NO. It starts NOW. I’m gonna shower, do my skincare, journal, set out work out clothes for the morning, and write a grocery list. My vapes are in the outside trash bins.  I’m gonna suffer. Oh man this shit is going to be fucking torture in the beginning. I’m gonna be cranky. I’m gonna be tired. I’m gonna crave things. But I’m determined to become disciplined. The pity parties are over.  I’ve never been so done with my own bullshit before. I have a notebook every day to write down things I take accountability for that day and things I’m grateful for as well.  Any tips / support / etc are welcomed. Just had to get this off my chest!","29F — I’m DONE living this way.  It changes TODAY.. I’m finally just completely fed up with myself and my lifestyle.

"7 lessons from ""Atomic Habits"" that actually changed how I build habits (and why I was doing everything wrong)","Read this book during a particularly rough patch where I'd start strong with new habits but always quit within a week. Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me: 1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results. 2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS. 3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it. 4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve. 5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit. 6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died. 7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits. What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to?

Until I came across something called the “Let Them” Theory and honestly, it changed how I move through life. 👉 Let them judge. 👉 Let them walk away. 👉 Let them doubt you. Because peace doesn’t come from explaining. It comes from letting go. You stop wasting energy trying to control the uncontrollable. You become more focused, calm, and clear. Curious if anyone here has adopted something similar? Has “letting go” improved your peace or focus?","The most freeing mindset shift I’ve made in years: The ‘Let Them’ Theory.

Boredom will tell you who you are,"If you don’t know what you want out of life, it could be because you’ve been distracted to such an extent that you’ve lost touch with who you are. This can and does happen; chronic distraction makes it so you avoid emotions, especially the bad ones, which leads to more avoidance in the future, and that's one way how you end up with alexithymia. Your feelings start to only communicate with you on the surface; they lose their essence, and this can be confusing; fear can be anger, anger can be disappointment, etc. For example, you may dislike your job, but you probably don’t fully understand what deeply bothers you about it. Or your friends, your interests, etc You may want to scream or cry, and don’t even realise it. Boredom does help with this, well, now we call it boredom since we barely give ourselves time to sit down and think. Unstructured thinking time and idle time are very much needed for your body; that time is used to go through what happens in the day, help you sift through your emotions, etc Let’s do a quick test: Can you put the phone down and do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes? no? Well, my friend, it's time for some much-needed alone time. It doesn’t feel good, you’re going to be emotionally pent up and have a lot of emotional debt to go through, but it gets better, eventually. The pleasure that comes with silence, being present, things slowing down, and you knowing who you are and what you want, is hard to exaggerate. It’s strange and beautiful to see stillness and yourself slowing down, to know what you actually feel, and to be able to put together what you want out of life. Also, and maybe this isn’t advertised enough, boredom can breed creativity; it can actually become a problem if you meditate. People who meditate will know what I’m talking about. Sometimes the ideas you get while meditating are so good you have to stop the session just to write them down.","Boredom will tell you who you are.

Accepting that I’ll likely stay single for life has eliminated a lot of stress,"28, male, straight. I grew up being awkward. During middle school I was “the weird kid”. During high school I became the “Nice but awkward guy”. During my early 20’s, somehow, I was able to land dates with women. It was to the point that sometimes I’d have 2 separate dates in a single night. During this time I met my 1st and only girlfriend. We didn’t date very long; she broke up with me. And ever since it’s been nothing. The dates went from being a regular thing to once every year or 2. I’m not sure why or how but I ended up developing severe social anxiety (still dealing with it) and I sorta forgot how to talk to women. It got to the point I couldn’t really maintain eye contact with anyone or I’d stutter. Safe to say that I went back to being awkward lol and I think women, very quickly, picked up on my regression. lately, I’ve reflected a lot on why I’ve been so desperate for a relationship. I think it boils down to wanting validation. There are a lot of reasons why I craved external validation, too many (and personal) for me to go into for this post. Also, I just have a hard time connecting with other people. But realizing these facts made me accept myself. I realized that I am too awkward for anyone. But I don’t want that to be a reason why I hate myself; I mean well, I think I’m a good person, I just don’t do well conversing with people. And so I’ve accepted that I may just end up being single for life. But, in a way, I feel free. I no longer feel forced to constantly “self improve” for a hypothetical woman. I still want to be a good person for the sake of being a good person, not so someone will love me. At the end of the day, I’m awkward and introverted. Even if no one can accept me romantically, at least I can accept myself regardless if I’m in a relationship or not. I’m happy that I’m able to move past the dating apps. Constantly checking every day to see if I have that dream match. Or worrying how a female colleague may perceive me. I feel free to simply be myself now, even if that means just keeping to myself. It’s all in the past now.","Accepting that I’ll likely stay single for life has eliminated a lot of stress. 28, male, straight. I grew up being awkward. During middle school I was “the weird kid”.

"[Story] How I stopped hating myself for ""bad"" habits and started understanding them instead","look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else. If this sounds dumb, it probably is and sorry in advance. I used to think being accountable to myself meant being harsh. like if i wasn't being ""productive"" or doing well mentally, i needed to track everything and push harder. but that just made me feel worse about myself most of the time. the problem was tracking the wrong things. I was obsessing over streaks and consistency instead of paying attention to how things actually made me feel like for example i'd force myself to meditate for 20 minutes daily to keep my streak alive even when 5 minutes felt better. or i'd scroll social media then beat myself up about it instead of understanding why i was doing it. So i switched it up to tracking three simple things for activities that are supposed to help my mental health: how calm i feel (1-10), how present I was (1-10), and how ready i feel to tackle things (1-10). that's it. no streaks, no guilt if i miss days. what i love is it's not about being perfect instead it's about being curious. some days i take great breaks and feel amazing. other days i doom-scroll for 20 minutes and rate it a 2 for restoration. both are valuable because they build self-awareness about what actually helps my mental state versus what i think should help. the funny thing is understanding my patterns without judgment made me naturally choose better habits. when you see that 10-minute walks consistently rate 8/10 but scrolling rates 3/10, the choice becomes obvious. Being kind to yourself doesn't mean giving up on self-care, it means building awareness about what actually helps your mental health and choosing those things more often. Try rating how you feel after different activities tomorrow. just awareness, no judgment. it's been a game changer for my mental health.","[Story] How I stopped hating myself for ""bad"" habits and started understanding them instead. look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else.

14 Days Into Full Dopamine Reset — I Feel Like I’m Breaking,"DISCLOSURE: I used ChatGPT to compile this post. I’ve been typing my thoughts into it for the better part of 2 weeks as a coping mechanism to get through this time. I asked it to compile a post of my thoughts to share here. I see it has upset many people and I understand why. It seems insincere. But, nonetheless, these are my exact thoughts…. I’m 41. Two weeks ago, I hit a wall. Not just emotionally — spiritually, mentally, physically. I cut everything: alcohol, weed, porn, video games, nicotine, even Instagram memes. I was chasing dopamine in every corner of my life just to avoid sitting with myself. So I decided to burn it all down and start over. Now I’m here. 14 days in. And I feel like I’m losing my mind. Most days I wake up at 2 or 3am with my nervous system jacked. I can’t get back to sleep. My thoughts race. My chest feels tight. I feel trapped inside a mind that won’t shut up — telling me I’m broken, unlovable, pathetic. The voice is relentless. And the worst part? The silence. Without all the stimulation, I’m left face to face with the core of my pain. Childhood stuff. Shame. Relationship failures. The feeling that I’ve never been enough. It’s not just boredom — it’s an existential flatness. Like I’ve lost all color. I’ve been doing everything right — workouts, cold showers, sauna, journaling, therapy, breathwork, even reading The Masculine in Relationship. I’m doing the work. And it still feels like I’m crawling through hell. I didn’t expect peace right away. But I didn’t expect to feel this hollow either. I’m not looking for sympathy — I just needed a place to be brutally honest. I want to believe there’s something on the other side of this. That I’m not just tearing down my coping mechanisms only to find there’s nothing underneath. If anyone else has been in this space — really in it — and made it through… I’d appreciate anything you’ve learned. Thanks for listening.","14 Days Into Full Dopamine Reset — I Feel Like I’m Breaking. DISCLOSURE: I used ChatGPT to compile this post.

Dumped 32F sugar baby at a loss on what to do moving forward,"The title says it all.. Struggling to find a path and even how to navigate life from here on. I don't know who I am, how to move forward, how to find passions and how to be a person/citizen.. I've realised this too late.. In a nutshell, I've been a sugar baby for the past 12 years. We met on an app when I was 20, and he put me up in an apartment, paid for my lifestyle and expenses for the past 10 years or so. It was a lush lifestyle, I travelled extensively, ate lavishly and saw the world with him.. and it's as though I lived in heaven for the past decade and now have been dropped flat into hell.. I wasn't sure what was going through my mind, why I didn't plan for the possibility that he would drop me like a bomb one day, I just didn't want to think of the possibility. I didn't do much at all except to keep him company, go shopping when he was at meetings and just enjoy life really..  No work experience whatsoever, very little discipline and nothing on my cv whatsoever. I have a little to fall back on in some money I've made from selling some of my gifts and things received in the past, it's paid for the room that I am renting.. but otherwise I am depressed and my mind is so blank everyday out of fear for the future..

I expect some harsh words and judgement for the naive way I've just skirted through life.. how on earth does one find oneself after something like this..","Dumped 32F sugar baby at a loss on what to do moving forward.

How do you treat yourself to actually enjoy your free time after work?,"Being a workaholic it's very easy for me to be stuck in the grind daily and then it's weekend and I keep thinking this entire week just went gone by work stuff so I've been trying now after work, to just give myself some time for rest doesn't matter if it's cooking some food, or even spending the afternoon hitting some games on Stake while relaxing.

How do I turn my life around after wasting 6 years?,"I really need honest and realistic advice. I'm 23 years old. Ever since graduating high school, I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety. For the past 6 years, I've done nothing no job, no college, no friends, no relationship. I live in a small town, I’m poor, have no vehicle, and I honestly don’t know where to start. Right now, I'm overweight, lonely, and I have no hobbies or interests. My teeth are in bad condition because I neglected basic hygiene for years. I rarely shower or go outside. Getting out of bed feels like a huge task, so I usually just stay in bed all day, sleeping or scrolling through Reddit. My sleep schedule is messed up I sleep at 3 AM and wake up around 11 AM, with no structure or motivation. Since childhood, I’ve isolated myself and mostly just played video games. Now I feel like a useless adult who completely wasted their life. I constantly feel tired, lost, and confused. Life feels heavy, and I don’t know where to begin. I have no skills, no connections, and I suffer from severe anxiety especially social anxiety. Even talking to people or going outside makes me feel panicked or ashamed. I also have a bad habit of asking for advice and then not acting on it. I don’t know why—I guess I just get overwhelmed and freeze. But it’s been 6 years of this cycle. I can’t afford therapy because I’m broke, so I’m trying to reach out online, hoping that someone’s words might help me break through. I’ve recently enrolled in college, but I still feel anxious, scared, and like I don’t belong there. My question is: What are some small, concrete steps I can take to start rebuilding my life? I need a basic plan for someone truly starting from zero. TL;DR: I’ve been stuck in my room for 6 years, barely leaving the house because I live in a boring small town. I’m overweight, poor, with bad teeth and no hygiene routine. I have no job, no degree, no friends, no relationship, no skills, and no connections. I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety. I just sleep, lie in bed, and scroll Reddit. I often ask for advice but never take action. I can’t afford therapy. I want to change but feel completely lost.","How do I turn my life around after wasting 6 years?. I really need honest and realistic advice. I'm 23 years old.

Your mind is MURDERING the person you want to be...,"In my previous post I wrote about how your brain tricks you into thinking preparation equals progress. How it keeps you researching fitness routines instead of going to the gym, or planning business ideas for years without ever starting one. But I need to clear something up because some people completely misunderstood what I was saying. I wasn't telling you to stop preparing entirely. I was trying to show you that your mind weaponizes preparation against you by making it feel like actual movement forward. There's a difference between preparation that serves execution and preparation that replaces it. One builds toward action, the other substitutes for it. The real problem isn't that you prepare it's that you've been conditioned to mistake the feeling of preparation for the feeling of progress. Your mind learned that researching, planning, and organizing gives you the same dopamine hit as actually doing the work, but without any of the risk. So you get addicted to the simulation of progress instead of demanding the real thing from yourself. When I say ""stop preparing,"" I mean stop using preparation as a way to avoid the discomfort of being bad at something new. Stop treating every unknown variable as something that needs to be solved before you can move. Real preparation is functional. It's limited and It has an expiration date. You prepare until you have enough information to take the next step, then you take it. You don't prepare until you feel confident but until you can start ugly. Most people prepare until they feel ready, which means they never start because readiness is not a feeling that comes from nothing. It's a byproduct of doing. Your mind wants you to believe that more information will eventually eliminate uncertainty but uncertainty is not a bug in the system it's the entire point. The person you want to become exists in the space where you act despite not knowing what will happen. In my previous post I mentioned ""What You Chose Instead"" for understanding this preparation trap, but the so called "" Gold Edition "" of this ebook is on a completely different level. This version covers the psychological frameworks they can't discuss in the standard edition (the unfiltered protocols for people who are serious about breaking these mental patterns permanently). It's not only about identifying the trap but also rewiring the entire system that creates it. Honestly, if you're tired of playing games with yourself and want material that doesn't hold back, the Gold Edition is the only thing I've seen that goes THIS deep into how your mind actually operates versus how you think it operates. If this doesn't get you moving idk what will honestly. As i said before you can find it on the ""ekselense"" site or just add ""ebook"" when searching for it. Preparation without execution is just elaborate procrastination. Start before you feel ready, but start smart. Thanks for reading through i'm happy if this helps even 1/3 of people it helped last time since there was sooooo many positive comments and everything. Thanks yall i'm very glad this resonates (and if it doesn't read it again 😂)","Your mind is MURDERING the person you want to be....

I cannot stop thinking about how many partners my boyfriend had.,"I am 23(F) and my boyfriend is 27(M). We have known each other and been on and off since I was 18. He never really wanted a relationship until the end of the last year. We always used to end it by him saying that he doesn’t want anybody and me crying my guts out. I couldn’t really explain our relationship to any of my friends or family because they just made him look bad and said that I was the victim he is just using, which was not the case. We both knew it was much more complex than that. I have been out of the country for a year because I couldn’t take our on and off situation-ship and came back because I really missed my family.  We ran into each other last year and really started to have more serious conversations and spend our time listening to each other. We are currently living together and he is being super nice and loving . He supports me in every way possible and I do love him so much.  Unfortunately I ruin a lot of our days by thinking of how many girls he used to have. (He did admit it and I also know a lot of those girls in person). I think about him having sex with them and how much he enjoyed it(all while I was waiting for a single text from him and never really managed to live properly until I went out of the country, even then, I can count on my fingers how many days I didn’t think about him). I am taking it out on him because I am unable to keep those thoughts inside of me and I keep asking for the details and he (understandably) started to lose his shit.  I am aware of my self destructiveness and now it is affecting another person too. I am just bad at everything that I do and constantly compare myself to other women. I hate me when I am like that and when Im not like that I still think that I am not enough so I circle back in with this bad habit.  It is really unbearable for both of us and I feel so sorry that he has to go through this but at the same time don’t know if Im ever gonna be able to feel secure.","I cannot stop thinking about how many partners my boyfriend had..

I don’t want to waste my life anymore. I just want to become someone I’m proud of.,"I’m 30. Sitting in my room, feeling like life is slipping through my fingers. I had chances. I lived in Australia.

How do you treat yourself to actually enjoy your free time after work?,"Being a workaholic it's very easy for me to be stuck in the grind daily and then it's weekend and I keep thinking this entire week just went gone by work stuff so I've been trying now after work, to just give myself some time for rest doesn't matter if it's cooking some food, or even spending the afternoon binge-watching anime while relaxing.   Leisure doesn’t have to be something ridiculous i THINK like just do something you enjoy because you simply deserve it lol.

Good careers that don’t require degrees,"I’m 23, so I don’t know if I’m really open to going back to school. Feel like I’m too old for that, and most of my peers have degrees and jobs now, plus I’m already in debt. I am open to stuff like certificates, programs, and other options though. Is it pretty much only sales and trades or else I’m cooked? I used to consider the tech industry, but it feels like that’s not really realistic anymore in 2025. I just want something that’s respectable and pays well. Is it over for me? I recently got on ADHD meds and I’m really trying to turn my life around.","Good careers that don’t require degrees.

I Only Feel Driven When I’m With Someone – Is That Normal or a Deeper Issue?,"I’ve been noticing a frustrating pattern in my life, and I wonder if anyone else relates. Whenever I’m in a relationship or even just talking to someone I care about, I feel driven, focused, and motivated to improve myself. I’ll hit the gym harder, stay off vices, study more, and overall feel like I’m building towards something. But the moment I’m alone — no partner, no emotional anchor — it’s like I hit a plateau. The motivation dies. Courses stay unopened. I drift back into old habits and vices. It’s not depression exactly… it’s more like I lose the fire because I have nothing to fight for. Recently I almost repeated an old mistake — trying to go back to someone from the past (girl A) while talking to someone new (girl B). The reason? I realized it’s not even about the girl… it’s about chasing a version of me who had more purpose when someone was around. And I’ve done this before, with someone else. It’s a pattern. Now I’m wondering — is this a form of emotional dependency? Is my identity too tied to external relationships? Or is it just part of being human to crave that kind of fuel? Would really appreciate any insight or similar experiences. How do you stay consistent when no one is watching?","I Only Feel Driven When I’m With Someone – Is That Normal or a Deeper Issue?.

The REAL Reason You’re Procrastinating (It’s Perfectionism!),"Most people think procrastination is about laziness or poor discipline. It’s not. It’s perfectionism in disguise. I realised this recently, after years of struggling with productivity. As a kid, I was severely bullied. I internalised that the only way to get love or approval was by standing out, by being exceptional. Success equalled worth, and worth equalled love. This belief made me a perfectionist. Every task felt overwhelming because I needed to do it perfectly. Instead of starting, I’d procrastinate endlessly. Eventually, this pushed me toward addictive behaviours: social media, porn, anything to distract from my anxiety and sense of inadequacy. Through therapy and reflection, I finally understood what was happening. My procrastination was rooted in fear of not being perfect. But perfectionism isn’t just my story; it’s everywhere. Maybe your parents were perfectionists. Maybe you were praised only when you excelled. Whatever the reason, it’s more common than we realise. The truth is, you don’t need to be exceptional every day. You just need to be consistently mediocre. If you can manage 80% effort consistently, you’re doing amazing. Productivity isn’t about bursts of perfection. It’s about steady effort. Long-term results come from consistent, imperfect action, not flawless but sporadic execution. Realising this changed everything for me. I dropped my addictions, improved my mental health, and started seeing real progress. A book that absolutely transformed my understanding was the CBT Workbook for Perfectionism by Sharon Martin. I genuinely believe that if I’d read it 5 years earlier, I would’ve become a completely different person by now. If you feel stuck, procrastinating, or overwhelmed, check your perfectionism. It might just be what’s holding you back.","The REAL Reason You’re Procrastinating (It’s Perfectionism!). Most people think procrastination is about laziness or poor discipline. It’s not.

Procrastination Causes Everything Bad in Your Life,"I've noticed a lot of people confuse real productivity with just time-slotting, so I pulled together the strategies that keep me productive during the semester and finals week. (1) Learn and internalize the rule: If something takes less than 2 minutes, just do it. This simplifies everything. (2) Break tasks into 15- to 45-minute chunks. If you feel like doing more, that's great - but limit scheduled tasks to 45 minutes max. (3) Make it as easy as possible to start a new task. Set things up so the first step takes zero willpower. Sometimes I just open the doc and stare at it for a while. That still counts. It gets me moving. (4) Never do more than 3 new or challenging tasks a day - you'll overload yourself and feel unproductive because you didn’t reach what you aimed to do. (5) Plan your time in your calendar. Work in bursts. Be realistic - and borderline generous - with your breaks. The Pomodoro technique recommends a 5-minute break for every 25 minutes of work. I don’t like that - 5 minutes is way too short.   So I made my own: a 15-minute break for every 45 minutes of work. If you occasionally need 30 instead of 15, that’s totally fine. But do it without guilt. To take breaks guilt-free, reframe them as productivity boosters. True productivity doesn’t come from time spent - it comes from results. From work completed.   By breaking, you’re able to finish more in less time and rest better for the next 45-minute block. (6) Separate your work zone. I’m a broke college student. I can't afford studying at cafés all the time. So I trained myself: the couch is only for work. No scrolling, no lounging, no exceptions. Now when I sit there, my brain knows it’s time to work. Start small, and momentum will handle the rest. If anyone would like to add on to this list that would be great. I'm thinking we can bounce ideas here! PS: I'd also like to partially Credit Cal Newport for writing How to Become a Straight-A Student. Gave me a head-start on all this.","Procrastination Causes Everything Bad in Your Life.

But after burning out a few times, I started simplifying. Here’s what finally worked habits so small I couldn’t make excuses anymore: 1.

I prepare my environment the night before → Clean desk. Water bottle. Post-it with the first task. It removes decision fatigue and makes mornings smoother. 3. I track streaks visually → I use a calendar and a green marker. It’s silly but seeing 8 green Xs in a row is weirdly motivating. 4. I tie habits to identity → I stopped saying “I want to be productive” and started saying “I’m someone who values consistency.” It shifted how I show up. 5.

What snapped you out of keeping tabs on exes' social media?,"I know I shouldn't check their social media accounts because we aren't in each other's lives anymore and I know that is for the best.

Can we stop bashing people for liking productivity tools and planning their lives?,"Lately, there’s been this weird wave of cynicism on Reddit (and honestly across a lot of social media) where people act like using productivity systems, color-coding planners, or optimizing workflows is some kind of self-delusion or cringe behavior. Like somehow if you're into GTD, Notion dashboards, or daily highlight reels, you’re just pretending to be productive or ""fetishizing"" work. Let’s be real: for some people, planning isn’t just about maximizing output — it’s a form of expression, enjoyment, and even mental health care. Some people genuinely feel more focused, more in control, and more motivated when they write out their goals, organize their tasks, or highlight their day in a certain color. Why are we mocking that? Not everyone who uses productivity tools is trying to hustle 24/7 or squeeze 300% efficiency out of their day. Some just like the structure. Some find peace in the ritual. Some people genuinely enjoy crafting the perfect to-do list, just like others enjoy journaling, drawing, or collecting vinyl records. There’s value in the process, not just the outcome. So yeah — productivity can be a means in itself. It doesn’t need to be justified by some giant leap in output or money made. If it makes someone feel better, more engaged, or just happier, then let them be. Critiquing toxic hustle culture is valid. But lumping all productivity enthusiasts into that same category and mocking them for ""liking planners too much"" is just lazy and bitter. Let people like what they like.","Can we stop bashing people for liking productivity tools and planning their lives?.

How do you forgive yourself for your own stupid mistakes? I’m absolutely lost.,"I’m old (65+) and I promised myself that I would stay active and stay in good shape.  Every other day, I do an intense (but very enjoyable) bike ride on our beautiful trails (in SW Illinois). On opposing days, I walk three miles. I got beautiful legs and I’m in excellent health.  Earlier this week, I went out to the garage (at 6:00 am) to get on my bike and I tripped on a step and went flying forward.  I hit the concrete hard and broke my arm (near the wrist) in three places.  Thankfully no surgery is needed but I am in constant pain (despite using pain killers) and I had to have a friend come stay with me because I can’t take care of myself.  How do I forgive myself for being so foolish? It was something that happened in one second but the doctor said that I can’t ride a bike again for 3-4 months.  My life right now is messy. My husband is chronically ill and has so many health problems. I was his caregiver and now I can’t even take care of myself.  I would be very grateful for any advice on how to get past this feeling of self loathing.  Ps. The constant pain is making everything so much worse.","How do you forgive yourself for your own stupid mistakes? I’m absolutely lost..

Your Desires Are Costing You Everything,"Owning a BMW isn’t a flex. Being seen pulling up in one isn't a flex either. The real flex is being someone who doesn’t feel the need to waste money on one. It’s an even bigger flex, in a way, if they can't afford one from choosing a more honest, meaningful, or manageable life over chasing more income - like not doing the kind of work that would leave them feeling lifeless, or refusing to work overtime because why put even more of your life into some job. And it's not just about having the money - it’s about wanting the thing in the first place. That desire itself is expensive. This is key! People rarely stop to ask where it came from or whether it’s even worth having. Before giving in to the pull, ask yourself: Could I save far more - financially and mentally - by tracing that desire to its root and letting it go? The BMW is just an example - it could be anything: a slightly nicer car, phone, kitchen, pair of trainers. That 'upgrade' feeling? You’ll get used to it in two weeks. Your daily experience won’t feel much different than it did before, or than it would with something simpler. In the end, a lot of what we chase comes down to image, ego, or unexamined habits. There’s nothing impressive about being controlled by that. What is impressive is having the clarity to opt out. Realise that your desires can be subject to change, if you dare to question them; which you absolutely should do, for your own benefit. You will discover that your desires can be replaced by higher, more meaningful ones that will result in a more meaningful life if you follow them instead. Don't play the game that the majority are playing. Beat it already.","Your Desires Are Costing You Everything. Owning a BMW isn’t a flex. Being seen pulling up in one isn't a flex either.

Your mind is MURDERING the person you want to be...,"In my previous post I wrote about how your brain tricks you into thinking preparation equals progress. How it keeps you researching fitness routines instead of going to the gym, or planning business ideas for years without ever starting one. But I need to clear something up because some people completely misunderstood what I was saying. I wasn't telling you to stop preparing entirely. I was trying to show you that your mind weaponizes preparation against you by making it feel like actual movement forward. There's a difference between preparation that serves execution and preparation that replaces it. One builds toward action, the other substitutes for it. The real problem isn't that you prepare it's that you've been conditioned to mistake the feeling of preparation for the feeling of progress. Your mind learned that researching, planning, and organizing gives you the same dopamine hit as actually doing the work, but without any of the risk. When I say ""stop preparing,"" I mean stop using preparation as a way to avoid the discomfort of being bad at something new. Stop treating every unknown variable as something that needs to be solved before you can move. Real preparation is functional. It's limited and It has an expiration date. You prepare until you have enough information to take the next step, then you take it. You don't prepare until you feel confident but until you can start ugly. Most people prepare until they feel ready, which means they never start because readiness is not a feeling that comes from nothing. It's a byproduct of doing. Your mind wants you to believe that more information will eventually eliminate uncertainty but uncertainty is not a bug in the system it's the entire point. The person you want to become exists in the space where you act despite not knowing what will happen. In my previous post I mentioned ""What You Chose Instead"" for understanding this preparation trap, but the so called "" Gold Edition "" of this ebook is on a completely different level. This version covers the psychological frameworks they can't discuss in the standard edition (the unfiltered protocols for people who are serious about breaking these mental patterns permanently). It's not only about identifying the trap but also rewiring the entire system that creates it. Honestly, if you're tired of playing games with yourself and want material that doesn't hold back, the Gold Edition is the only thing I've seen that goes THIS deep into how your mind actually operates versus how you think it operates. If this doesn't get you moving idk what will honestly. As i said before you can find it on the ""ekselense"" site or just add ""ebook"" when searching for it. Preparation without execution is just elaborate procrastination. Start before you feel ready, but start smart. Thanks for reading through i'm happy if this helps even 1/3 of people it helped last time since there was sooooo many positive comments and everything.

I Finally Accepted Willpower is a Scam. I'm Tricking My Brain Instead.,"For years I was stuck in the self-improvement loop. I'd read the books and get a huge rush of motivation to be disciplined. A week later I'd be back at square one, feeling like a total failure. Every time I failed it just felt like more proof to my brain that I was fundamentally lazy. The big change happened when I stopped trying to force myself and started trying to trick my brain instead. I learned our brains are just simple prediction machines that want to be proven right. So I stopped fighting my lazy side and just started feeding my brain tiny bits of proof that I was already the person I wanted to be. But just telling myself ""I am disciplined"" was useless. The real key was creating a system that forced my hand and made the proof undeniable. I had to attach a real, tangible consequence to my daily actions to make them non-negotiable. That was the only way to stop my brain from making excuses. It feels strange to say the only way forward was a system with real stakes. But it's the only thing that has ever actually created lasting change for me. Has anyone else found they need to rig the game with real consequences to finally make progress?","I Finally Accepted Willpower is a Scam. I'm Tricking My Brain Instead..

I learned our brains are just simple prediction machines that want to be proven right. So I stopped fighting my lazy side and just started feeding my brain tiny bits of proof that I was already the person I wanted to be. But just telling myself ""I am disciplined"" was useless. The real key was creating a system that forced my hand and made the proof undeniable. I had to attach a real, tangible consequence to my daily actions to make them non-negotiable. That was the only way to stop my brain from making excuses. It feels strange to say the only way forward was a system with real stakes. But it's the only thing that has ever actually created lasting change for me. Has anyone else found they need to rig the game with real consequences to finally make progress?",ArkkGraphics,102,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1m4hvum/i_finally_accepted_willpower_is_a_scam_im/,1752992590.0,68.1,selfimprovement,1m4hvum
Excess drinking sent me into A-fib,"35m here, going through a lot of intensely difficult and stressful things (breakup, business being sued, can't afford bills, etc). In this time I've quit kratom and developed a daily gym habit but it hasn't been enough to cope. My drinking replaced my kratom habit. I started doing online dating and drinking everyday. Dates most nights of the week and heavy drinking with it. Resulted in my heart going A-fib yesterday while I was at work and they had to shock my heart back into rhythm. Holiday heart syndrome is what I was told is likely happening, I've been drunk everyday for the last 2 weeks which is very out of the ordinary for me and my body. I'm just posting here for some accountability somewhere. I've got to quit drinking for at least 2 months and I'll have some time to consider it permanent but ultimately something has to change for good. It's time to get serious about my health, today I'm deciding to be better.","Excess drinking sent me into A-fib. 35m here, going through a lot of intensely difficult and stressful things (breakup, business being sued, can't afford bills, etc).

I regret being an introvert for most of my young adulthood,"I hope some people here can empathize with my experience. I used to be an extremely shy kid, I didn't dare to talk to anyone and everything was scary. The only friends I made in high school were the few that essentially 'adopted' me as their friend. I started trying to be more social once I was in university, but even then it was hard. I rarely went to parties, because crowds scared me.  My social development was stunted and I was an extreme late bloomer if you will. Somehow, slowly, I became less and less shy. I think part of that is confidence that comes with age and maturity. And now that I'm at that point where I feel more confident in approaching people, making friends, taking the initiative in social situations, etc. I keep regretting that I didn't have this confidence earlier. Now that I'm an adult, I wish I went to more parties, or events, or made more friends, when I was still in high school or university. I feel like I missed out on so much fun, chances to expand my life experience, friends, conversations, etc. All because I was too scared in my formative years.  A part that also stings is seeing that extrovert people just seem to have more fun and opportunities, largely because they are more outgoing and go-getters. I work full-time now, and one of my boss' remarks is that I do good work, but I also need confidence to show it more. I'm trying to 'catch up' on some of my earlier shyness by motivating myself to join events and such, but it's still hard. I know it's good for me, and yes I do want it! But it's hard. It doesn't come naturally to me the way it does for natural extroverts. After a day of socializing, I'm drained. I know people always say 'if you're comfortable being alone, then just stay alone'. But if I have to be honest, I don't feel comfortable, I feel lonely. I wish I had a large friend group that I could go with to events or parties or on a vacation. But I just don't. And I wish I made those friends when it was still easy. Thanks for reading, let me know if you relate.","I regret being an introvert for most of my young adulthood.

Most people die before they're buried.,"They stop growing somewhere in their twenties and spend the next forty years defending that decision. Watch how people talk about their dreams. Past tense. ""I used to want to..."" ""I was going to..."" ""I thought about..."" They speak about their ambitions like obituaries, mourning possibilities they killed through inaction. The death happens slowly. First, you postpone the big move. Then you rationalize why the risk isn't worth it. Then you surround yourself with people who validate your smallness. Then you mistake comfort for contentment. Then you stop noticing the difference between existing and living. You become a ghost haunting your own life, going through motions that used to have meaning, settling for scraps of the feast you were supposed to create. But here's what nobody talks about: this death is reversible. The person you buried under layers of compromise and excuses is still alive. They're just suffocating under the weight of who you pretended to be to keep everyone else comfortable. Most people think they're too old, too late, too far behind to resurrect their real ambitions. They've convinced themselves that ship has sailed. But that ship never left. It's been waiting at the dock while you found reasons not to board. The uncomfortable truth is that you're not stuck because circumstances trapped you. You're stuck because you stopped believing you deserved to escape. You're not limited by your resources. You're limited by your relationship with your own potential. Every day you accept less than what you're capable of, you're choosing to stay dead. Every day you avoid the work that scares you, you're choosing the grave over growth. There's an ebook ""What You Chose Instead"" that confronts exactly this pattern of living death - how people systematically choose comfort over capability and then wonder why life feels hollow. It explains how to resurrect the ambitions you buried and why most people unconsciously prefer the predictability of unhappiness to the uncertainty of pursuing what they actually want. Your dreams didn't die of natural causes. You suffocated them with reasonable excuses. Stop planning your funeral. Start planning your resurrection.","Most people die before they're buried..

How to regain brain speed and productivity,"For background I have adhd, some anxiety, and have recently been addressing some of the largest sources of long lived depression.

Unfortunately I think due to living with the depression and dissociation practically my whole life, I believe my brain has adapted to it and my brain just feels under active all the time. It’s as if it’s scared of powering up again and dealing with whatever caused the dissociation in the first place. Tasks feel like they take so much mental preparation. Deep thoughts feel impossible. I’m so bored now and everything feels like so much effort that I just feel I have nothing else to do but to sleep or stare at the wall all the time.","How to regain brain speed and productivity.

More below I’m nearly 28 years old and have hated myself since I was a pre teen, I grew up in a family that mocked everything about me and one that didn’t nurture parts of me. I grew up with no confidence, low self esteem and naive with no knowledge of the world. As you can imagine this only intensified once I hit puberty.  I have BPD, depression, anxiety, I deal with executive dysfunction and I do not leave my house it’s really hard to.  I have no desire to live.

No amount of “you have to want more of yourself or your life will be like this forever” does anything for me. It’s like I’m just waiting to pass. I’m letting life happen for me while I sit and watch it go by.  I think I do want to fix this but can not bring myself to do anything for myself. I do not love myself enough to try and the hatred, pity and remorse I feel for myself does nothing either.  I can not bring myself to just do things and I do not know why.

If you have been through this please give me a step in the right direction as I am completely at a loss.  In regards to therapy, I was rejected for psychotherapy (government funded) I think about 2 years ago now. This broke me and eventually I realised that I don’t think therapy can even help me in this current state.  I recently tried to get private therapy but was told that my issues were too severe for them to help. As you may guess I didn’t take that well. I eventually came to believe that maybe therapy can not help me in my current state anyway as I have such a strong defeatist mindset that has not shifted in over 18 years that it would do me no justice. Is this true? If you have had the same mindset as I have, did therapy help? What kind of therapy was it?  The only therapy that I found quite helpful was compassion therapy which I had over I think 3 years ago or so.  Please be specific in what therapy you think would help if you are suggesting this, I have tried normal talking therapy, compassion and CBT (but that was very early on when I was a young adult and I have yet to try that again).

The people around you are programming your limitations.,"Your environment is quietly shaping what you think is possible. And most people never realize how much their social circle is capping their potential. When everyone around you operates at the same level, that level becomes your ceiling. Their problems become your problems. Their excuses become your excuses. Their definition of ""realistic"" becomes yours. You start to mirror their energy, their ambition, their standards. Without noticing, you begin to think their way, move their way, limit yourself their way. The conversations you have, the goals you set, the risks you're willing to take - all of it gets calibrated to match the people you spend time with. This is why breakthrough progress often requires isolation. Not because other people are bad, but because their unconscious expectations become your unconscious barriers. They don't mean to hold you back, but their comfort with mediocrity becomes contagious. The hardest part isn't identifying toxic relationships. The hardest part is recognizing when good people are accidentally limiting your growth simply by normalizing a lower standard of existence. Most people are unconsciously committed to keeping you at their level. They need you to stay relatable. They need you to validate their choices by making similar choices. When you start operating differently, it makes them uncomfortable about their own limitations. Real growth requires becoming comfortable with being misunderstood by people who knew the old version of you. It requires disappointing people who expect you to stay predictable. There's this book ""What You Chose Instead: GOLD EDITION"" that explores how to navigate social dynamics when you're trying to level up beyond your current circle (you can find it on the ""ekselense"" site). It breaks down when to help, when to distance yourself, and how to become unreachable to your former patterns without burning bridges unnecessarily. Your future self exists in a different social environment than your current self. Stop trying to drag your old relationships into your new reality. Sometimes isolation isn't loneliness. Sometimes it's liberation.","The people around you are programming your limitations.. Your environment is quietly shaping what you think is possible.

Trying hard things that i always neglected boosted my confidence & motivated me to do it daily [Text],"Do the hard thing in your life.The “hard thing” in your life might not be what others expect. For one person, it’s starting a business. For someone else, it’s walking into a room full of strangers. And that’s the thing, “hard” is personal. That’s why it matters. For me, hard is showing up in real life, especially in social settings. I’ve had this weird fear of being seen or judged, and for a long time, I avoided anything that made me feel exposed or vulnerable. I wouldn’t speak up, I’d avoid people, and just drift under the blanket because it felt safer.  Maybe for you it’s waking up at 5 AM. Maybe it’s telling someone the truth. Maybe it’s asking a stupid question, applying for a job, or walking into a gym or learn cooking. Whatever it is, do that. Hard things stretch your limits. They strip away the excuses. They build postive ego and boosts your confidence and most importantly it fills the ""boring"" space in your life.  Give yourself your own daily missions. I did the same and i have shared on my sub red. It feels great to challenge yourself daily despite if you fail.","Trying hard things that i always neglected boosted my confidence & motivated me to do it daily [Text].

What 4 Months of Voice Journaling Did to My Mental Clarity,"I started voice journaling as an experiment to process thoughts more clearly.

I don’t overthink spelling, grammar, or even coherence. The goal is to speak freely. Over time, I noticed: - Fewer racing thoughts during the day - Easier decision making - More gratitude and clarity around what’s bothering me It’s like therapy, but free.

How do I even find a career if I'm not really good at anything or intelligent or social,"This is a serious title, but I'm turning 30 soon and my dad who I've been relying on my entire life is reaching the end of his working life and I honestly don't really know what to do anymore. I want to take over payments on his house at some point (it doesn't make that much sense to move from where I'm at since I'm never going to marry anyway and it's a very boring but safe area) but the only jobs I've ever been able to get are retail and food service and have never really excelled in those either.  I've been offered management track positions a few times but my superiors have pretty much told me I'd have to do a complete 180 personality wise over time to be an effective manager type and I'm honestly way too lenient to ever be a ""good"" retail manager or whatever. I graduated with a computer science degree in May but screwed it up so badly I don't think it's even possible to get a job (less than 3.0 GPA, on top of having quite literally nothing to put on my resume, no internships, no class projects, literally nothing at all other than the classes I've taken lol) in the field plus it doesn't seem realistic that they'd hire someone who is about to turn 30 with such a bad GPA having taken so long to graduate (it took me almost 9 years to finish).

This is a serious title, but I'm turning 30 soon and my dad who I've been relying on my entire life is reaching the end of his working life and I honestly don't really know what to do anymore. I want to take over payments on his house at some point (it doesn't make that much sense to move from where I'm at since I'm never going to marry anyway and it's a very boring but safe area) but the only jobs I've ever been able to get are retail and food service and have never really excelled in those either.  I've been offered management track positions a few times but my superiors have pretty much told me I'd have to do a complete 180 personality wise over time to be an effective manager type and I'm honestly way too lenient to ever be a ""good"" retail manager or whatever.

I don’t even enjoy my phone anymore… so why can’t I stop?,"The moment I put my phone down, it feels like my skin starts crawling. Silence feels wrong. I stare at a wall for 30 seconds and then BAM I’m unlocking my phone again with no idea why. It’s like my brain can’t handle stillness anymore. I used to think I had great self-control. But this? This is something else. It’s like I’ve trained my brain to need constant stimulation and now I don’t know how to undo it. Is this just normal now? Like is everyone silently freaking out like this too? Has anyone actually recovered their focus or peace of mind? I’m not looking for some cliche just meditate advice. I want to hear from people who actually made it out the other side.","I don’t even enjoy my phone anymore… so why can’t I stop?. The moment I put my phone down, it feels like my skin starts crawling.

[Tool] I made a playlist to help me do daily 30min of Japanese walking.,"So, recently i came across this trending thing - ""japanese walking technique better than 10k steps a day"", so I have made it my mission to pursue it for a month. But i was having trouble maintaining the slow and fast pace in timely manner, so i came up with a idea to help myself.  And hence, lo and behold I made a playlist to help myself.  Sharing here, so hopefully it can be of help to someone else.  [Context] What is the Japanese walking technique? Japanese interval walking, also known as Interval Walking Training (IWT) is a structured walking technique developed in Japan, which alternates between moderate to fast-pace walking in interwals. This technique involves alternating three minutes of slow walking with three minutes of brisk walking, for 30 minutes daily.","[Tool] I made a playlist to help me do daily 30min of Japanese walking..

My two best friends are dating and I kinda hate it,"I’ve been in a trio with my two favorite people in the world (male and female) for 2 whole years now and I’ve always suspected they had a thing for eachother. The thing is that they’ve been denying it for this whole time so I kind of accepted the fact that they were simply just closer to eachother than they were to me or our friend group. However, a few days ago my friend confessed that they decided to be in a relationship and that they had already kissed in the past (and kept it hidden from me which I get but also annoys me), and I reacted well at first, I was just a bit shocked but I figured it would be fine since they have always acted like a couple even when they weren’t official. But now I just feel so damn uncomfortable. It’s not like they kiss in front of me or anything, because it weirds them out too, but for example now we’re on vacation together so we sleep in the same room and I hear them kissing and telling eachother “I love you” when they think I’m sleeping,which just makes me uncomfortable. The problem is that I feel like a bad friend, and I objectively am, because I just can’t stand the thought of them together, but I can’t figure out why I feel this way. They’ve always been like this!! So why now that it’s official I’m so disgusted with it? I should be happy and supportive, which I am, even if I’m faking it most of the time to make them feel less uncomfortable. What do I do? It’s like I’m third wheeling in a trio, which is insane…. Any idea why I feel this way?","My two best friends are dating and I kinda hate it.

"You don’t need self improvement, you just need a passion","I have been on the productivity journey for 4 years. Over that time, I never felt good enough as is. This led me to constructing elaborate routines. In the morning I would make my bed, meditate, do gratitude, say affirmations, everything you see gurus tell you to do. I believed that I needed to do this to feel fulfilled and valuable. I was wrong. Over that time, that feeling of not being enough never changed. I remained the same mentally. While these habits have their benefits, they never addressed the root. What I lacked over this time period was a purpose. Something to work towards that I could get good at and use to provide for myself and those I care about. Last year I found a desire to build software and apps. Ever since pursuing this, I have felt a sense of purpose as opposed to trying different morning routines. I am making this post to hopefully open your eyes if you feel like you are wandering aimlessly. I credit where I am to those habits because they built a foundation. Without a purpose though, the habits only served as a temporary direction. TL;DR Don’t just rely on habits, find a skill to pursue that will fill your time and give you purpose","You don’t need self improvement, you just need a passion.

Only 16 days into habit tracking but already seeing why people swear by this,"Hey, I know I'm super early in the game here, but I wanted to share what I've noticed in just over 2 weeks of tracking my habits because honestly, I'm surprised by how much it's helping already. Background: I'm usually the person who starts strong with new routines but gives up after a week or two. Classic story, right? But something feels different this time. What I tracked: * Morning routine (wake up time, make bed, 10min meditation) * Workout (just 20-30min, nothing crazy) * Reading (aimed for 15min daily) * Water intake (trying to hit 8 glasses) * Evening phone-free time What I'm already noticing: Even in just 16 days, I can see some patterns forming. Like, the days I skip my morning routine usually correlate with staying up too late the night before (shocking, I know 😅). The visual aspect is surprisingly motivating. There's something about seeing those checkmarks that makes me want to keep the momentum going. I've only missed 3 days total so far, and instead of feeling like a failure (usual me), I just picked back up the next day. Early observations: * My mornings feel less chaotic when I stick to the routine * The 15min reading goal feels totally manageable (vs my old ""read for an hour"" impossible standard) * I'm actually drinking way more water just because I'm paying attention to it What's working so far: * Starting small (seriously, the bar is LOW and that's helping) * Not beating myself up over missed days * The satisfaction of checking things off is real I know 16 days isn't long enough to call this a life transformation, but I'm cautiously optimistic. For the first time, I don't feel like I'm white-knuckling through a routine change. Anyone else find that tracking helps with consistency? Or am I just in the honeymoon phase? 😂 Update: I am using a web app routine-kit.com because i like that it syncs between devices and i basically free to use.","Only 16 days into habit tracking but already seeing why people swear by this.

I’ve always had this belief in my head: if I can’t do something perfectly, then maybe I shouldn’t even start. It feels like something is only worth doing if I can give it my 100%. But the result is that I get stuck, constantly planning, thinking, analyzing, but never actually doing. Whether it’s a new goal, a project, or even just a small habit, I keep thinking: either I start from day one doing it flawlessly, or I’ve already missed my window; either I go all-in, or I’m not in the right state to even begin.

I’m honestly tired of myself sometimes. I know this way of thinking is flawed. But I still find it really hard to escape this all-or-nothing mindset. I really admire people who can “just start,” even when things are messy or imperfect. I want to learn how to embrace progress over perfection, but I don’t know where to begin.

My ex ruined me and it’s time to change that.,"tldr: I have trust issues due to betrayal trauma and likely attachment issues from childhood that have manifested themselves in deep anxiety and ptsd episodes. I have tried to manage it on my own but i’ve failed and it’s time to get help. I’ve never considered myself someone who needs a professional intervention, but I do. It was a tough pill to swallow as an independent lady. I want to be happy and secure and a good partner to my really devoted and amazing boyfriend.  I consider myself a smart, capable, driven, ambitious, and attractive woman in my late 20s. I live in a global city and got here with zero help from my family or anything like that. I had a fucked up childhood, yet I made it out and I’ve carved a nice path for myself. Have a good job and can finally start making a dent in my student loans. I’m not saying this to brag, I’m saying it because I can usually solve issues on my own and have great resolve. I am independent. It’s a prideful point for me. I am in a relationship with an amazing man. He is truly just a catch — attractive, emotionally in touch, empathetic, caring, so much fun, smart, the whole nine yards. Comes from a good family. He has not done anything to hurt me, we’ve been dating for 1.5 years and our 1 year (official) anniversary is coming up. YET…. yet… I am inundated with fear. My ex, to keep it brief, was a pathological liar, a hedonistic loser, manipulative and deceitful. I have suffered significant betrayal trauma. Why I stayed with this man for so long (years!), I could not tell you. I was young, blind, getting really bad advice from those around me, and manipulated by him. Definitely depressed at some point, and wrapped up in the thick of it. Never saw a healthy relationship modeled in my life, so, I thought longevity was the key to relationships. Wrong!!!! He ruined me. He ruined my ability to trust myself, trust my partner. I am full of anxiety to the point where my chest hurts and I cannot concentrate b/c I am expecting something HORRIBLE to happen to my relationship, because I was so used to that dynamic playing out. It’s not constantly like this, but I have triggers that send me into episodes. These episodes are so hard. I swear I have PTSD. I have rapid, intrusive thoughts about all the bad things my partner could be doing to me behind my back — even though there is zero evidence to support any of it, he is so devoted and faithful.  I signed up for therapy because unfortunately I can’t manage this on my own. I need to sort this out because this relationship means more to me than I could have ever imagined. I’m tired of it myself, but I also am cognizant that my partner has to support me in this, and while he is soooo thoughtful when it comes to this stuff, he likely has his limits and he deserves a partner who is just as confident and secure as he is. As our relationship deepens and cements more, my fears and anxiety grow stronger. I’m so done feeling this way. I just want to be happy and enjoy my little life and my relationship.","My ex ruined me and it’s time to change that.. tldr: I have trust issues due to betrayal trauma and likely attachment issues from childhood that have manifested themselves in deep anxiety and ptsd episodes.

Used to light up every time shit got overwhelming. Now I’m just learning to sit with it instead. [Discussion],"Honestly, for all this years, stress just meant straight up smoking to me.   Bad day? puff. Not a good day at office - puff lunch break - smoking. argument with someone- Smoke. Being bored at 2AM overthinking life? Yet again Smoke Lighting up a cigg literally became like a muscle memory, like the second I felt anything uncomfortable, I was outside with a cigarette before I even realized what I was doing.

"Just turned 24, lost in life.","Hey, I just turned 24 today, and honestly, I feel completely lost in life. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Finance when I was 22. I live in a very small city with barely any job opportunities, so I decided to use my savings to study for the CFA Level 1, hoping it would help me land my first job. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. The exam center was a 4-hour drive away, and on the day of the exam, my car broke down. I arrived late, and they didn’t let me in. I lost the chance AND lost the savings, I was devastated, but I kept going and continued studying for no reason. Then suddenly I lost four family members over the past two years, and it made it really hard to stay consistent or focused. Eventually, I decided to stop studying and try to gain some work experience — even though there are no real finance opportunities in my city. I managed to get an unpaid internship at a small local consulting office, an hour away from home, and I stayed there for four months. At one point, I even worked at a bank’s call center for about a month. The job drained me mentally and physically, I got tinnitus due to that job, and it made my anxiety worse, I was barely holding it together, so I quit.  I’ve been applying to jobs everywhere in the country. I’m especially interested in investment management, and earlier this year I reached out to a firm that runs a well-known internship in that field. I asked whether they’d be opening it again this year, but never received a response. I kept checking their website every single day, and the moment it opened, I applied, but I didn’t even get an interview. Just silence. It’s been crushing. I’m not even considered a fresh graduate anymore, and I only have one internship that’s not directly related to the field I want. Moving away for another unpaid internship isn’t financially possible, especially now that my family is going through a tough time too. Lately, I’ve been thinking about shifting careers entirely, maybe to Human Resources, since there seem to be more job opportunities. But I feel completely burned out. I’ve started to hate my degree. It feels like I’ve poured everything I have, time, effort, money and in return, every door just keeps closing. Something always goes wrong, no matter how hard I try. I used to genuinely love my major. Now it feels like a waste of time. I just want a job that pays well and doesn’t destroy my mental health. I’m tired, and I truly don’t know what to do anymore.  Any advices?","Just turned 24, lost in life.. Hey, I just turned 24 today, and honestly, I feel completely lost in life. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Finance when I was 22.

Going back to retail after 2 years working corporate…,"I miss it. I miss the energy. I miss the camaraderie. I miss getting my steps in. Honestly, I just miss the whole vibe. Yeah, there were parts I hated, and believe me, I hated them. But there’s way more I can’t stand about the office. At the office, I feel like a shell of myself. Tense. Timid. Stressed. I dread meetings. Half the time I feel like an idiot. I was stressed at the warehouse too, but office stress hits different. It lingers. It sticks to you. At the warehouse, I felt more like me. More relaxed. More fun. More personable. I could walk in and yell, “What’s up, motherfuckers!” and nobody blinked. There was room to breathe, to joke around, to not take everything so seriously. The vibes were just better. The biggest reason I want to go back is because I actually felt valued there. Respected. I wasn’t just being tolerated. I was celebrated for what I brought to the table. I’m transferring in a couple months, and I’m honestly excited. I’ve got a different mindset now. I left the warehouse thinking the grass was greener at corporate. It wasn’t. And the best part is, if I ever do want to go back to the office, I can. My company’s great about transfers, and I’m grateful for that kind of flexibility. But still. Fuck corporate. I’m keeping my benefits, taking a small pay cut, and it’s absolutely worth it.","Going back to retail after 2 years working corporate…. I miss it. I miss the energy. I miss the camaraderie.

"For those who have hated themselves all their lives, how did you change? For those who did not have any motivation and will to change your life, what helped you overcome this?","If you are going to suggest therapy please be specific on which type of therapy. More below I’m nearly 28 years old and have hated myself since I was a pre teen, I grew up in a family that mocked everything about me and one that didn’t nurture parts of me. I grew up with no confidence, low self esteem and naive with no knowledge of the world. As you can imagine this only intensified once I hit puberty.  I have BPD, depression, anxiety, I deal with executive dysfunction and I do not leave my house it’s really hard to.  I have no desire to live. I am idly living in a dissociative state and I have been for some time now. Nothing interests me or brings me joy anymore and I have no desire to try to make a difference. How do I change this? No amount of “you have to want more of yourself or your life will be like this forever” does anything for me. It’s like I’m just waiting to pass. I’m letting life happen for me while I sit and watch it go by.  I think I do want to fix this but can not bring myself to do anything for myself. I do not love myself enough to try and the hatred, pity and remorse I feel for myself does nothing either.  I can not bring myself to just do things and I do not know why.

If you have been through this please give me a step in the right direction as I am completely at a loss.  In regards to therapy, I was rejected for psychotherapy (government funded) I think about 2 years ago now. This broke me and eventually I realised that I don’t think therapy can even help me in this current state.  I recently tried to get private therapy but was told that my issues were too severe for them to help. As you may guess I didn’t take that well. I eventually came to believe that maybe therapy can not help me in my current state anyway as I have such a strong defeatist mindset that has not shifted in over 18 years that it would do me no justice. Is this true? If you have had the same mindset as I have, did therapy help? What kind of therapy was it?  The only therapy that I found quite helpful was compassion therapy which I had over I think 3 years ago or so.  Please be specific in what therapy you think would help if you are suggesting this, I have tried normal talking therapy, compassion and CBT (but that was very early on when I was a young adult and I have yet to try that again).

I failed my CS degree — but I still want to become a software developer at 26,"Hey everyone, I’m 26 years old, and I’ve been carrying the weight of failure for a while now. I was studying computer science, something I was genuinely passionate about, but due to a mix of psychological abuse, poor mental health, and being in a university that offered little support or structure, I ended up failing. It’s something I deeply regret — not just because of the missed degree, but because I let others' treatment of me dictate how I saw myself. For a while, I felt like I had no future. I hit rock bottom. But after some soul-searching, I’ve realized I still love tech. I love solving problems. I love the logic, the creativity, the power of building things from nothing. So I’ve decided to start over — not in university, but by building my skills from the ground up. I’m currently dedicating 10 hours a day to learning and doing actual projects — web development mostly, with an eye on full-stack development. I’m learning everything I should’ve learned before — but this time, I’m not doing it for grades. I’m doing it to build a life. I guess I’m posting this for a few reasons: To know I’m not alone. Are there others here who took the non-traditional or ""failed"" route but still made it? To get some honest advice: If you were in my shoes, what would you focus on right now to break into the field? To remind anyone else in the same position: it’s not over if you’re still willing to fight. Thanks for reading. I’m not asking for pity — just perspective.

"I’m 24 and I feel like a failure, even though my life looks ok on paper","Hi everyone, I just need to get this off my chest and maybe get some perspective. I'm 24 years old. I’m in a committed (and happy) 7 years relationship, I have great friends, a loving family, I get to travel twice a year and have no debt.  I’m currently doing an MBA (I have a bachelor’s degree in advertising/communication). I do well in my field and at school : I got all the great jobs I wanted and even got an honorific mention from my University for my grades. So on paper… things seem really good. But internally, I feel like a total failure. Most people in my circle are doctors, engineers (as my boyfriend is in engineering) — people with very “prestigious” and clear-cut paths. Meanwhile, I can’t help but feel like my background is kind of BS.  When I was younger, I had big dreams: going to Harvard, law school, writing books, doing something great. But now it feels like that version of my future quietly slipped away without me realizing. Lately, I’ve been wondering: were my expectations too high? Should I apply to law school now? Or do I just want to prove to people that I’m “worthy” — to finally feel smart and impressive like everyone else around me? Every few weeks I spiral into an existential crisis, questioning whether I’m on the right path or if I messed it all up already. Has anyone else felt like this — like you’re doing okay, but also like you’re somehow behind in life? How do you know if it’s time to change direction, or if you’re just chasing validation? Thanks for reading. I appreciate any insight.","I’m 24 and I feel like a failure, even though my life looks ok on paper.

What’s the real reason you try to be productive?,"I’ve been asking myself lately, 'Why am I trying so hard to be productive in the first place?' Not just to check off tasks or meet expectations. But what’s the deeper reason? For me, it comes down to this: I want to earn more of my own time. When I’m productive, I can get through the essential stuff faster(work, errands, admin, etc), so I can carve out space to focus on things I actually care about. Whether that’s reading, creating, spending time with people I enjoy, or simply doing nothing without guilt. It’s not really about doing more for the sake of doing more. It’s about building enough efficiency and clarity into my day so I can reclaim time for myself. Ironically, I’m productive so I can spend less of my life working. Maybe that’s why digital detox has become such a thing. When we cut out distractions, we’re not just “unplugging.” We’re actively choosing to spend time on ourselves rather than giving our attention away to feeds and algorithms.

The person holding you back is just… you. In my case, the last block between me and my raw potential was social anxiety. I kept thinking I needed another plan, another reset but what I really needed was to act like the version of me I daydream about. The one who is free, bold, and untouchable.

"34F Interpreter with a useless degree in the US, tried ecommerce, still lost. Trapped and tired. Please tell me there’s a way other than divorce and go back","Hi everyone,   I’m 34F, currently living in the US and waiting on my marriage-based green card. I’m originally from abroad and have a degree in translation which, to be honest, is useless here in the US job market. Over the past few years, I started two ecommerce brands on my own. I built the stores, handled all the marketing, wrote the copy, learned Facebook ads, ran creatives, managed freelancers... All of it. I enjoyed the creative side and got decent feedback. But in the end, they just weren’t profitable enough to sustain. So I shut them down. And now I feel stuck. I’m not a complete beginner — but I also don’t have a ""real"" profession here in the US.   I’m not looking for overnight success or a dream job.   I just want to build something real. A skillset I can rely on. A career that’s stable and I can build.  Are there any real career paths someone like me can start from scratch?   Any courses or certifications worth taking now, so that when I get work authorization, I’ll be ready to aplly for jobs? If you’ve been in a similar place (immigrant, mid-30s, career-shifting, not rich) please share what helped.Even if it’s just encouragement, I’d be incredibly grateful. Thank you so much for reading.

I quit my toxic job!,"Thank God! Yesterday – after four long years of suffering under toxic colleagues, heartless bosses, endless night shifts, and employers who never cared about my well-being – I finally quit my miserable minimum-wage job for good. Now, I'm pursuing trade school to master automotive mechanics, and this is my ticket to freedom. This is more than just a career change – it's my escape from the matrix. No more being forced to follow someone else's rules, no more sacrificing my peace for a paycheck that barely covers survival. I'm claiming the life I've always dreamed of: one where my skills give me true independence. With this trade, I'll fix and flip cars, build my own shop, and create multiple income streams through B2B and B2C parts sales. And I'm not stopping there – I'm pairing my technical skills with a business degree to make sure my future is unshakable. Today, on my 25th birthday, I've learned life's most valuable lesson: being your own boss isn't just an option – it's the only way to avoid a life of mental, financial, and physical struggle. This is my rebirth. My revolution. The moment I stop surviving and start truly living. The future I deserve begins now.","I quit my toxic job!.

I can't find a job with an MD degree and I'm going insane.,"Idk if I can post something like this here, I'm not sure where else I can ask for help and advice.  This is an anonymous account because I'm truly embarrassed at how miserable I am. I really don't know what else to do, I've ran out of ideas and really have no one who actually knows anything about my situation or how to help so I thought my last chance was here on reddit.  So long story short, I'm a non EU citizen, living in an unsafe country with terrible economy and government. I finished medical school in a good European university last year. Since I was a scholarship student, I had no money to stay until it was time for the job interviews of my own university's hospital so I returned home. And my stupid-ass country suddenly decides to tell me after all these years, oh yeah btw we don't actually accept your degree... Only half-accept it. So come give an exam, pay us AND redo the last couple of years, internship, along with your thesis all over again so we'd accept your degree...  That being obviously absurd and me having no plan or preference to stay here, I threw the whole idea away. So I sat down and began studying German... I was almost about to go to Germany to get ready for the German medical language exam, then my family was hit with a huge financial crisis. So if I don't have some kind of support for accommodation and costs or a direct job offer, Germany is also off the table. Lucky me, I have no family outside my country.  So I thought to apply for PhDs, and one after another I got rejected, rejected, rejected. I applied to over 40. Then I tried the UK, used my last remaining cents and got GMC registered and applied to any FY1/FY2 positions I saw. For over 6 months now. And 45 applications later... I don't even have a single interview.  I applied for non doctor jobs like Care Worker, Assistants, etc. And since I do digital art I even applied for artist positions abroad. But still nothing.  Only recently I started to work as an English language teacher in my country just so I don't rot in my house. But the pay is so astronomically low that I won't be able to save for even a small vacation inside my own country for like 5 years.  The only thing I gained this past year was palpitations, severe depression and insomnia. I'm truly at my wits end and have terrible thoughts about my life sometimes. At my age and with my terrible relationship with my retired parents I can't stay with them at all, and living in my own country is like living in exile, so I need to be as far away as possible.  I'm literally willing to start any job just to get out of the current quicksand im stuck in.
